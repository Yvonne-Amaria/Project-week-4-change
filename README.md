*About us*

Just by inputting of their city, a list of hotels will be presented to them, and from their choice, they'll be required to put in their intended check-in and check-out date. The price and tax rates will be outputted along with different options to get the best rates for booking.
The registration into this app is pretty seamless, and once a user is registered, they can now log in with just their username and password for easy access of the app.
